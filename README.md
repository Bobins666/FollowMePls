## FollowMePls

![Preview of FollowMePls](https://github.com/techiew/FollowMePls/blob/master/preview.png)

This is an addon for **World of Warcraft Classic.** 

This addon lets anyone make you follow them when they whisper you "**!follow**". This is useful when you have a friend that routinely goes AFK, or if your friend loses his follow after he got stuck. By default, only party and raid members can make you follow them, you can change this with a command.

Only the person that is going to follow needs to have this addon installed, not the one whispering.
